The workspace uses Cursor IDE with specific settings for ontology maintenance:

- `.cursor/settings.json`: Workspace-specific settings
- `.cursor/prompt.md`: AI assistant configuration
- `macos_window_control.ttl`: Main ontology file

## Ontology Structure

The ontology tracks:
- Window management systems
- Configuration storage locations
- Research findings
- Verification status

## Required Core Ontologies

The following core ontologies are referenced:
- meta.ttl
- metameta.ttl
- conversation.ttl
- problem.ttl
- solution.ttl

## Development Guidelines

1. All research findings must be documented in the ontology
2. Verification status must be tracked for all storage locations
3. TODO section must be maintained with pending tasks
4. All new classes and properties must follow validation rules

## Usage

When using this workspace:
1. Ensure Cursor IDE is configured to use the `.cursor` settings
2. Follow the ontology maintenance guidelines in `.cursor/prompt.md`
3. Update research findings and verification status as new information is discovered
